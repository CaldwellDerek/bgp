## Description
This was originally a collaborative project done between myself and my classmates. The  repository can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Bram-G/Board-Game-Party) and the deployment [HERE](https://bram-g.github.io/Board-Game-Party/). I sought to build this project on my own as a way to challenge myself and continually learn. I decided to build this from scratch and to eliminate the use of frameworks. I also wanted to focus more on mobile responsiveness and create an application that works well on all screen sizes.

This project offers an easy to use application that allows you to quickly find board games based off of search criteria. Board Game Party displays a game's information such as number of players, time to play, age group, and it's description. The application also lets you quickly navigate to where the game can be bought. Furthermore, every searched game will generate a youtube tutorial video on the game as well as a list of similar games.
